# AVClass

[AVClass](https://github.com/malicialab/avclass) 
is a malware labeling tool.

You give it as input the AV labels for a large number of 
malware samples (e.g., VirusTotal JSON reports) and it outputs the most 
likely family name for each sample that it can extract from the AV labels. 
It can also output a ranking of all alternative names it found for each sample.

The design and evaluation of AVClass is detailed in our 
[RAID 2016 paper](https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/avclass_raid16.pdf):

> Marcos SebastiÃ¡n, Richard Rivera, Platon Kotzias, and Juan Caballero. 
AVClass: A tool for Massive Malware Labeling. 
In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Research in 
Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses,
September 2016.

In a nutshell, AVClass comprises two phases: 
preparation (optional) and labeling.
Code for both is included, 
but most users will be only interested in the labeling, which outputs the 
family name for the samples. 
The preparation produces a list of aliases and generic tokens 
used by the labeling. 
If you use our default aliases and generic tokens lists, 
you do not need to run the preparation.

**Why is AVClass useful?**

Because a lot of times security researchers want to extract 
family information from AV labels, 
but this process is not as simple as it looks, 
especially if you need to do it for large numbers (e.g., millions) of 
samples. Some advantages of AVClass are:

1. *Automatic.* 
  AVClass removes manual analysis limitations on the size of 
  the input dataset.

2. *Vendor-agnostic.*
  AVclass operates on the labels of any available set of AV engines, 
  which can vary from sample to sample.

3. *Cross-platform.*
  AVclass can be used for any platforms supported by AV engines, 
  e.g., Windows or Android malware.

4. *Does not require executables.*
  AV labels can be obtained from online services like VirusTotal 
  using a sample's hash, even when the executable is not available.

5. *Quantified accuracy.* 
  We have evaluated AVClass on 5 publicly available malware datasets with 
  ground truth. Details are in the above RAID 2016 paper. 

6. *Open source.*
  The code is available and we are happy to incorporate suggestions and 
  improvements so that the security community benefits from AVClass.

**Limitations**

The main limitation of AVClass is that its output depends on the input 
AV labels. 
It tries to compensate for the noise on those labels, but 
cannot identify the family of a sample if AV engines do not provide 
non-generic family names to that sample. 
In particular, it cannot label samples if at least 2 AV engines 
do not agree on a non-generic family name. 
Results on 8 million samples showed that AVClass could label 81% of the 
samples. 
In other words, it could not label 19% of the 
samples because their labels contained only generic tokens.

Still, there are many samples that AVClass can label and thus we believe 
you will find it a useful tool. 
We recommend you to read the discussion section in our RAID 2016 paper for 
more details.

## Labeling 
   
The labeler takes as input 
a JSON file with the AV labels of malware samples (-vt or -lb switches), 
a file with generic tokens (-gen switch), 
and a file with aliases (-alias switch). 
It outputs the most likely family name for each sample.
If you do not provide alias or generic tokens files, 
the default ones in the *data* folder are used.

```
$./avclass_labeler.py -lb data/malheurReference_lb.json -v > malheurReference.labels
```
  
The above command labels the samples whose AV labels are in the 
*data/malheurReference_lb.json* file.
It prints the results to stdout, 
which we redirect to the *malheurReference.labels* file.
The output looks like this:

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 adrotator
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d adultbrowser
```

which means sample aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 is most likely 
from the *adrotator* family and 
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d from the *adultbrowser* family.

The verbose (-v) switch makes it output an extra 
*malheurReference_lb.verbose.verbose* file
with all families extracted for each sample ranked by the number of AV 
engines that use that family.
The file looks like this:

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539  [(u'adrotator', 8), (u'zlob', 2)]
ee90a64fcfaa54a314a7b5bfe9b57357  [(u'swizzor', 19)]
f465a2c1b852373c72a1ccd161fbe94c  SINGLETON:f465a2c1b852373c72a1ccd161fbe94c
```

which means that for sample aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 
there are 8 AV engines assigning *adrotator* as the family and  
another 2 assigning *zlob*.
Thus, *adrotator* is the most likely family.
On the other hand, for ee90a64fcfaa54a314a7b5bfe9b57357 there are 19 AV 
engines assigning *swizzor* as family, 
and no other family was found.
The last line means that for sample f465a2c1b852373c72a1ccd161fbe94c
no family name was found in the AV labels. 
Thus, the sample is placed by himself in a singleton cluster 
with the name of the cluster being the sample's hash.

Note that the sum of the number of AV engines may not equal the number 
of AV engines with a label for that sample in the input file 
because the labels of some AV engines may only include generic tokens 
that are removed by AVClass.


## Input JSON format

AVClass supports two input JSON formats: 

1. VirusTotal JSON reports (*-vt file*), 
where each line in *file* should be the full JSON of a 
VirusTotal report as fetched through the VirusTotal API.

2. Simplified JSON (*-lb file*),
where each line in *file* should be a JSON 
with (at least) these fields:
{md5, sha1, sha256, scan_date, av_labels}. 
There is an example of such input file in *data/malheurReference_lb.json*

**Why have 2 different input formats?**

We believe most users will get the AV labels using VirusTotal. 
However, AVClass is IO-bound and a VirusTotal report 
in addition to the AV labels and hashes includes 
much other data that AVClass does not need. 
Thus, when applying AVClass to millions of samples,
reducing the input file size by removing unnnecessary data 
significantly improves efficiency. 
Furthermore, users could obtain AV labels from other sources and 
the simpler the input JSON format, 
the easier to convert those AV labels into an input file.

At this point you have read the most important information on how to use 
AVClass. 
The following sections describe steps that most users will not need.

## Labeling: PUP Classification

AVClass also contains a switch to classify a sample as
Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) or malware.
This classification looks for PUP-related keywords
(e.g., pup, pua, unwanted, adware) in the AV labels and was proposed in our
[CCS 2015 paper](https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/papers/malsign_ccs15.pdf):

> Platon Kotzias, Srdjan Matic, Richard Rivera, and Juan Caballero.
Certified PUP: Abuse in Authenticode Code Signing.
In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security, Denver, CO, October 2015

```
$./avclass_labeler.py -lb data/malheurReference_lb.json -v -pup > malheurReference.labels
```

With the -pup switch the output of the *malheurReference.labels* file
looks like this:

```
aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 adrotator 1
67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d adultbrowser 0
```

The extract digit at the end is a Boolean flag that 
indicates sample aca2d12934935b070df8f50e06a20539 is
(likely) PUP, but sample 67d15459e1f85898851148511c86d88d is (likely) not.

In our experience the PUP classification is conservative,
i.e., if it says the sample is PUP, it most likely is.
But, if it says that it is not PUP, it could still be PUP if the AV labels
do not contain PUP-related keywords.
Note that it is possible that some samples from a family get 
the PUP flag while other samples from the same family do not
because the PUP-related keywords may not appear in the labels of 
all samples from the same family. 

## Labeling: Ground Truth Evaluation

If you have ground truth for some malware samples, 
i.e., you know the true family for those samples, you can evaluate the accuracy of the labeling output by AVClass on those samples with respect to that 
ground truth.
The evaluation metrics used are precision, recall, and F1 measure.
See our RAID 2016 paper above for their definition.

```
$./avclass_labeler.py -lb data/malheurReference_lb.json -v -gt data/malheurReference_gt.tsv -eval > data/malheurReference.labels
```

The output includes these lines:

```
Calculating precision and recall
3131 out of 3131
Precision: 90.81  Recall: 93.95 F1-Measure: 92.35
```

The last line corresponds to the accuracy metrics obtained by 
comparing AVClass results with the provided ground truth.

Each line in the *data/malheurReference_gt.tsv* file has 
two **tab-separated** columns:

```
0058780b175c3ce5e244f595951f611b8a24bee2 CASINO
```

which indicates that sample 0058780b175c3ce5e244f595951f611b8a24bee2 
is known to be of the *CASINO* family.
Each sample in the input file should also appear in the ground truth file.
Note that the particular label assigned to each family does not matter. 
What matters is that all samples in the same family are assigned the 
same family name (i.e., the same string in the second column) 

The ground truth can be obtained from publicly available malware 
datasets. 
The one in *data/malheurReference_gt.tsv* comes from the 
[Malheur](http://www.mlsec.org/malheur/) dataset. 
There are other public datasets with ground truth such as 
[Drebin](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/) or 
[Malicia](http://malicia-project.com/dataset.html).


## Preparation: Generic Token Detection

The labeling takes as input a file with generic tokens that should be 
ignored in the AV labels, e.g., trojan, virus, generic, linux.
By default, the labeling uses the *data/default.generics* 
generic tokens file.
You can edit that file to add additional generic tokens you feel 
we are missing.

In our RAID 2016 paper we describe an automatic approach to 
identify generic tokens, which requires ground truth, 
i.e., it requires knowing the true family for each input sample.
That is why we expect most users will skip this step and simply use our 
provided default file.
But, if you want to test it you can do:

```
 $./avclass_generic_detect.py -lb data/malheurReference_lb.json -gt data/malheurReference_gt.tsv -tgen 10 > malheurReference.gen 
```

Each line in the *data/malheurReference_gt.tsv* file has 
two **tab-separated** columns:

```
0058780b175c3ce5e244f595951f611b8a24bee2 CASINO
```

which indicates that sample 0058780b175c3ce5e244f595951f611b8a24bee2 
is known to be of the *CASINO* family.

The *-tgen 10* switch is a threshold for the minimum number of families 
where a token has to be observed to be considered generic. 
If the switch is ommitted, the default threshold of 8 is used.

For more details you can refer to our RAID 2016 paper.

**Output**

The above command outputs two files: 
*malheurReference.gen* and *malheurReference_lb.gen*. 
Each of them has 2 columns: token and number of families where the token 
was observed.
File *malheurReference.gen* is the final output with the detected 
generic tokens for which the number of families is above 
the given threshold. 
The file *malheurReference_lb.gen* has this information for all tokens.
Thus, *malheurReference.gen* is a subset of *malheurReference_lb.gen*. 


## Preparation: Alias Detection

Different vendors may assign different names (i.e., aliases) for the same
family. For example, some vendors may use *zeus* and others *zbot* 
as aliases for the same malware family. 
The labeling takes as input a file with aliases that should be merged.
By default, the labeling uses the *data/default.aliases* aliases file.
You can edit that file to add additional aliases you feel we are missing.

In our RAID 2016 paper we describe an automatic approach 
to identify aliases.
We expect most users will skip this step and simply use our 
provided default file.
But, if you want to test it you can do:

```
$./avclass_alias_detect.py -lb data/malheurReference_lb.json -nalias 100 -talias 0.98 > malheurReference.aliases
```

The -nalias threshold provides the minimum number of samples two tokens 
need to be observed in to be considered aliases. 
If the switch is not provided the default is 20.

The -talias threshold provides the minimum fraction of times that 
the samples appear together.
If the switch is not provided the default is 0.94 (94%).

For more details you can refer to our RAID 2016 paper.

**Output**

The above command outputs two files:
*malheurReference.aliases* and *malheurReference_lb.alias*.
Each of them has 6 columns: 
1. t1: token that is an alias
2. t2: family for which t1 is an alias
3. |t1|: number of input samples where t1 was observed
4. |t2|: number of input samples where t2 was observed
5. |t1^t2|: number of input samples where both t1 and t2 were observed
6. |t1^t2|/|t1|: ratio of input samples where both t1 and t2 
were observed over the number of input samples where t1 was observed.

File *malheurReference.aliases* is the final output with the 
detected aliases that satisfy the -nalias and -talias thresholds.
The file *malheurReference_lb.alias* has this information for all tokens.
Thus, *malheurReference.aliases* is a subset 
of *malheurReference_lb.alias*.
